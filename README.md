Ndsparse
========

N-dimensional sparse matrix implementation

Supported operations
=======
1. basic slicing
2. reshape
3. pairwise operations, add, mul, sub, div, with support of broadcast and work with scalars
4. reduce operations, max and sum, along specified axises, like `numpy.sum()` and `numpy.max()`
5. transpose `numpy.transpose()`
6. swapaxes `numpy.swapaxes()`
